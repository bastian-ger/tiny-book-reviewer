# tiny book reviewer

## Description
This app offers you the ability to check the current top 10 of the various NY
Times bestseller lists and write a little review about a book that you have
already read. Furthermore you can check your reading weather in 11 European
countries and the USA.

This little app was my first playground for bringing everything I've initially
learned about React and Redux to life. When coding this, the performance
of the app was not important as the focus was clearly on testing my
knowledge on React.

## How to use it
Choose one of the bestseller lists and then click on one of the books in order
to write a review about it. Check the instructions in the form. For the reading
weather choose your country and then your city name in order to get a weather
forecast for the next 5 days. You can read all reviews when clicking on
*Reviews*.

## Known Bugs
- console shows unidentified *Uncaught Syntax Error*
